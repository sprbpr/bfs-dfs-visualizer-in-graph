# BFS and DFS Visualizer in Graph

Finding the paths — and especially the shortest path — between two nodes is a well-studied problem in graph theory. This is because paths in a graph are frequently an interesting property. In the three jugs problem, a path from the start node to any node with 6 liters of water in one jug represented a solution to the riddle. In a social network, a path might show us how two people are connected, and the length of the shortest path between two people might tell us something about the social distance between them. In a graph representing roadways, the shortest path between two nodes might very literally represent the shortest path between two places.
